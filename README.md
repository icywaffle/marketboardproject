## Marketboard Project

[ffxivprofit](http://ffxivprofit.com/)

Designed to calculate whether a crafted item will give you profit.

Since it will be impossible to grab information about every single item in the game without putting a stressed load on any API,
it's better to just ask whether or not an item that you see will net you some profit, and what amount of profit.

Then with this, we can fill up a database full of items, eventually, to find
an item that has the highest amount of profit percentage.

## Motivation
Most current ffxiv related websites only have current marketboard price, and graphs of history,
but they never really show you what items make the most amount of money for 
the price of making them.

The point of this project, is to hopefully show whichs items are worth it to 
just buy materials off of the marketboard and then craft it, and which items
are not worth the effort to craft.

This requires a little more than just marketboard pricing, but also time costs
of obtaining materials, which may be a feature in the futre.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
A simplified programming language, that is great for web development,
and also has very clean syntax.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
A No-SQL Database, since there are certain items that do not follow
a strict Schema.
- [Revel](https://revel.github.io/)
A Full-Stack web framework to run the entire project.
- [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/)
A Front-End web framework that minimilistically styles the site.

<b>Additional Dependencies</b>
- [MongoDB-Go-Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver)
A MongoDB Driver that allows an easier way to access the mongodb.
- [SaintCoinach](https://github.com/ufx/SaintCoinach)
Extracts game assets from Final Fantasy XIV, i.e. Item Icons.

## Current Features
A search to be able to look for what items you want to craft.
Percentage of profit made if you currently sold according to the lowest listed price.
Sorted List of items with most profits.

## Future Features
Total List of prices and materials that you need for crafting.
Save your searched items into the database so that you can compare which items may net you more profit
A cost of time in how much materials to actually gather.

## Structure
The Home page brings you to a search bar that you use to be able to find a recipe ID corresponding to some recipe that you search.
This uses the javascript function

`function xivapisearch()`

which automatically concatenates the search string for the xivapi, and returns a list of items that you can click on. With these items, you click on, the javascript function

`function obtainrecipe(recipeid)` 

sends you to a page that is routed to the golang function

`func (c Result) Obtain() revel.Result`

which queries the database accordingly, and also inserts and queries the xivapi if the database does not have the information.

This is the basis in which the website builds upon information without needing to constantly query the XIVAPI.

## Testing

Tests can be accessed by going into /@tests in the browser.

Tests can be built by the `marketboard/tests` folder.
