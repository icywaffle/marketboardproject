# When we access a page /, it grabs the functions as well.
# Example : POST from /Result/Index.html calls the Obtain function, which renders the Obtain page.

# Catch all, this will route any request into the controller path

#                    **** WARNING ****
# Enabling this exposes any controller and function to the web.
# ** This is a serious security issue if used online **
#
# For rapid development uncomment the following to add new controller.action endpoints
# without having to add them to the routes table.
# *       /:controller/:action                    :controller.:action
